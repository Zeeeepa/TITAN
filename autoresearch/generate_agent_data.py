Generate multi-turn conversation training data for TITAN's Main Agent Model.

Produces JSONL training data that teaches the model TITAN's full agent protocol:
- OpenAI function calling format
- Multi-turn conversations with tool usage
- When to use tools vs answer directly
- Error recovery patterns
- TITAN identity and personality

Usage:
    python3 generate_agent_data.py            # Full generation with Ollama enhancement
    python3 generate_agent_data.py --no-llm   # Templates only, no Ollama calls
    python3 generate_agent_data.py --dry-run   # Print stats without generating
