This dramatically reduces the number of trainable parameters (often 0.1-1% of the original) while achieving similar quality to full fine-tuning."),
        ("Explain GGUF format", "GGUF (GPT-Generated Unified Format) is a binary format for storing quantized LLM weights. It's used by llama.cpp and Ollama for efficient CPU/GPU inference with reduced memory requirements."),
        ("What is a Zod schema?", "Zod is a TypeScript-first schema validation library. You define schemas as code (`z.object({name: z.string()})`) and use them to validate data at runtime, with full TypeScript type inference."),
        ("Explain event-driven architecture", "Event-driven architecture is a pattern where components communicate through events rather than direct calls. Producers emit events, and consumers react to them asynchronously, enabling loose coupling and scalability."),
        ("What is a JWT?", "JWT (JSON Web Token) is a compact, URL-safe way to represent claims between parties. It has three parts: header (algorithm), payload (claims), and signature. Used for authentication — the server verifies the signature instead of querying a database."),

        ("Explain the difference between SQL and NoSQL", "SQL databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL) use structured schemas and relational tables with ACID transactions. NoSQL databases (MongoDB, Redis) use flexible schemas (document, key-value, graph) and prioritize scalability over strict consistency."),
        ("What is Tailwind CSS?", "Tailwind is a utility-first CSS framework that provides atomic classes like `flex`, `p-4`, `text-lg` directly in HTML. Instead of writing custom CSS, you compose styles from pre-built utilities. Produces small bundles via tree-shaking."),

        ("What is a LoRA adapter?", "A LoRA adapter is a small set of trained low-rank matrices that modify a frozen base model's behavior. It's typically 1-5% the size of the full model and can be loaded/swapped at inference time, enabling efficient customization."),
        ("How does Ollama work?", "Ollama is a tool for running LLMs locally. It downloads and manages GGUF-quantized models, serves them via a REST API at port 11434, and handles GPU memory management. You interact with `ollama run model` or `POST /api/generate`."),

        ("Explain ESM vs CommonJS", "ESM (ECMAScript Modules) uses `import/export` syntax and is the standard for modern JS. CommonJS uses `require/module.exports` and is Node.js's legacy format. ESM is statically analyzable, supports tree-shaking, and is the future of JavaScript."),
        ("What is quantization in LLMs?", "Quantization reduces model precision from FP32/FP16 to lower bit widths (INT8, INT4). This shrinks model size and speeds up inference with minimal quality loss. Q4_K_M is a popular balance of size and quality."),
        ("Explain what Vite is", "Vite is a fast build tool for modern web projects. It uses native ES modules for instant dev server startup, and Rollup for optimized production builds. Much faster than webpack for development."),
